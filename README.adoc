== MacOS

Download your firmware and make note of the location. 
Here we assume the firmware has been downloaded in the default `Downloads` folder.

Run the following command:

    FIRMWARE=$HOME/Downloads/firmware.elf
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ED-MS/scripts/master/macos/install.sh)" $FIRMWARE
